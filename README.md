Navigating Tomorrow: The Interconnected Realms of AI Evolution, Politics, and Societal Liberty
Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of AI evolution, political regimes, and societal freedom. It investigates whether AI deployment in democratic governments prioritizes citizen well-being compared to authoritarian regimes.

🔍 Key Research Question:

Can the political regime of a country indicate the intent behind AI deployment?
How do AI advancements correlate with freedom and economic indicators?
What are the potential societal implications of AI across different governance models?
Through data-driven analysis, we examine the pace of AI development worldwide, identify trends in political freedom, and assess economic factors shaping AI policies.
